03:31:50 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
03:31:50 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y <= 1000000)
03:31:50 26/03/2025 Addind predicate y <= 1000000 to verify set
03:31:50 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['y <= 1000000']
03:31:50 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (<= y 1000000)
03:31:50 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((y <= 1000000))
03:31:50 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((y <= 1000000))
03:31:50 26/03/2025 # Result
03:31:50 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((y <= 1000000))
