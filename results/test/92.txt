02:00:54 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
02:00:54 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
02:00:54 26/03/2025 Addind predicate x == 0 to verify set
02:00:54 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 0)
02:00:54 26/03/2025 Addind predicate y == 0 to verify set
02:00:54 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['x == 0', 'y == 0']
02:00:54 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (= x 0) (= y 0))
02:00:54 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((x == 0) && (y == 0))
02:00:54 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x == 0) && (y == 0))
02:00:54 26/03/2025 # Result
02:00:54 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x == 0) && (y == 0))
