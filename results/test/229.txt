03:36:13 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
03:36:13 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 1 || x == 2)
03:36:13 26/03/2025 Addind predicate (x == 1) || (x == 2) to verify set
03:36:13 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['(x == 1) || (x == 2)']
03:36:13 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (or (= x 1) (= x 2))
03:36:13 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert(((x == 1) || (x == 2)))
03:36:13 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert(((x == 1) || (x == 2)))
03:36:13 26/03/2025 # Result
03:36:13 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert(((x == 1) || (x == 2)))
03:36:13 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
