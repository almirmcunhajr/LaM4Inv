05:22:13 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == 0)
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Addind predicate x == 0 to verify set
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 0)
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Addind predicate y == 0 to verify set
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z == 0)
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Addind predicate z == 0 to verify set
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['x == 0', 'y == 0', 'z == 0']
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (and (= x 0) (= y 0)) (= z 0))
05:22:13 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((x == 0) && (y == 0) && (z == 0))
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x == 0) && (y == 0) && (z == 0))
05:22:13 26/03/2025 # Result
05:22:13 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x == 0) && (y == 0) && (z == 0))
05:22:13 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
05:22:13 26/03/2025 The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
05:22:13 26/03/2025 The total runtime was 0.40239834785461426 seconds
