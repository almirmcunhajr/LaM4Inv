03:31:40 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
03:31:40 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(d1 == 1)
03:31:40 26/03/2025 Addind predicate d1 == 1 to verify set
03:31:40 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(d2 == 1)
03:31:40 26/03/2025 Addind predicate d2 == 1 to verify set
03:31:40 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(d2 == 1)
03:31:40 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['d1 == 1', 'd2 == 1']
03:31:40 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (= d1 1) (= d2 1))
03:31:40 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((d1 == 1) && (d2 == 1))
03:31:40 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((d1 == 1) && (d2 == 1))
03:31:40 26/03/2025 # Result
03:31:40 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((d1 == 1) && (d2 == 1))
03:31:40 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
