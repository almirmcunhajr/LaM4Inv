01:54:22 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert((x >= y))
01:54:22 26/03/2025 Addind predicate (x >= y) to verify set
01:54:22 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['(x >= 0)', '(y >= 0)', '(x >= y)']
01:54:22 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (and (>= x 0) (>= y 0)) (>= x y))
01:54:22 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert(((x >= 0)) && ((y >= 0)) && ((x >= y)))
01:54:22 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert(((x >= 0)) && ((y >= 0)) && ((x >= y)))
01:54:22 26/03/2025 # Result
01:54:22 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert(((x >= 0)) && ((y >= 0)) && ((x >= y)))
01:54:22 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
