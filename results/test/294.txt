05:22:31 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
05:22:31 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(xa + ya > 0)
05:22:31 26/03/2025 Addind predicate xa + ya > 0 to verify set
05:22:31 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['xa + ya > 0']
05:22:31 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (> (+ xa ya) 0)
05:22:31 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((xa + ya > 0))
05:22:31 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((xa + ya > 0))
05:22:31 26/03/2025 # Result
05:22:31 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((xa + ya > 0))
05:22:31 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
05:22:31 26/03/2025 The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
05:22:31 26/03/2025 The total runtime was 1.2870900630950928 seconds
