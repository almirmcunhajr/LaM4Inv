03:31:46 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
03:31:46 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == x)
03:31:46 26/03/2025 Addind predicate y == x to verify set
03:31:46 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['y == x']
03:31:46 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (= y x)
03:31:46 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((y == x))
03:31:46 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((y == x))
03:31:46 26/03/2025 # Result
03:31:46 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((y == x))
