05:20:50 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
05:20:50 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == y)
05:20:50 26/03/2025 Addind predicate x == y to verify set
05:20:50 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y >= 0)
05:20:50 26/03/2025 Addind predicate y >= 0 to verify set
05:20:50 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['x == y', 'y >= 0']
05:20:50 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (= x y) (>= y 0))
05:20:50 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((x == y) && (y >= 0))
05:20:50 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x == y) && (y >= 0))
05:20:50 26/03/2025 # Result
05:20:50 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x == y) && (y >= 0))
