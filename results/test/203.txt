03:31:43 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= 0)
03:31:43 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['x <= 1']
03:31:43 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (<= x 1)
03:31:43 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((x <= 1))
03:31:43 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x <= 1))
03:31:43 26/03/2025 # Result
03:31:43 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x <= 1))
