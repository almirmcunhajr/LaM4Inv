01:02:34 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
01:02:34 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c == 0)
01:02:34 26/03/2025 Addind predicate c == 0 to verify set
01:02:34 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert((n > 0))
01:02:34 26/03/2025 Addind predicate (n > 0) to verify set
01:02:34 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['c == 0', '(n > 0)']
01:02:34 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (= c 0) (> n 0))
01:02:34 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((c == 0) && ((n > 0)))
01:02:34 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((c == 0) && ((n > 0)))
01:02:34 26/03/2025 # Result
01:02:34 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((c == 0) && ((n > 0)))
01:02:34 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
01:02:34 26/03/2025 The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
01:02:34 26/03/2025 The total runtime was 0.9238786697387695 seconds
