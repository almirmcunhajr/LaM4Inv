05:20:56 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
05:20:56 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y > 0 || x > 0)
05:20:56 26/03/2025 Addind predicate (y > 0) || (x > 0) to verify set
05:20:56 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['(y > 0) || (x > 0)']
05:20:56 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (or (> y 0) (> x 0))
05:20:56 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert(((y > 0) || (x > 0)))
05:20:56 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert(((y > 0) || (x > 0)))
05:20:56 26/03/2025 # Result
05:20:56 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert(((y > 0) || (x > 0)))
05:20:56 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
05:20:56 26/03/2025 The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
