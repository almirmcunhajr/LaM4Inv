01:54:11 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(c == 0)
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert((y >= 0))
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Addind predicate (y >= 0) to verify set
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert((y >= 127))
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert((y <= 127))
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Addind predicate (y <= 127) to verify set
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['(y >= 0)', '(y <= 127)']
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (>= y 0) (<= y 127))
01:54:11 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert(((y >= 0)) && ((y <= 127)))
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert(((y >= 0)) && ((y <= 127)))
01:54:11 26/03/2025 # Result
01:54:11 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert(((y >= 0)) && ((y <= 127)))
01:54:11 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
01:54:11 26/03/2025 The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
01:54:11 26/03/2025 The total runtime was 0.5561611652374268 seconds
