02:00:37 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
02:00:37 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == y)
02:00:37 26/03/2025 Addind predicate x == y to verify set
02:00:37 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(lock == 1)
02:00:37 26/03/2025 Addind predicate lock == 1 to verify set
02:00:37 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['x == y', 'lock == 1']
02:00:37 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (= x y) (= lock 1))
02:00:37 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((x == y) && (lock == 1))
02:00:37 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x == y) && (lock == 1))
02:00:37 26/03/2025 # Result
02:00:37 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x == y) && (lock == 1))
