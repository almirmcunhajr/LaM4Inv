02:01:06 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j == 0)

02:01:06 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y == 2)
02:01:06 26/03/2025 Addind predicate y == 2 to verify set
02:01:06 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['y == 2']
02:01:06 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (= y 2)
02:01:06 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((y == 2))
02:01:06 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((y == 2))
02:01:06 26/03/2025 # Result
02:01:06 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((y == 2))
