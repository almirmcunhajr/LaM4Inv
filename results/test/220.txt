03:32:23 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x == w)
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Addind predicate x == w to verify set
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z == y)
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Addind predicate z == y to verify set
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x > 0)
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(y > 0)
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(z > 0)
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(w > 0)
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['x == w', 'z == y']
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (= x w) (= z y))
03:32:23 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((x == w) && (z == y))
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x == w) && (z == y))
03:32:23 26/03/2025 # Result
03:32:23 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x == w) && (z == y))
03:32:23 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
03:32:23 26/03/2025 The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
