03:31:41 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
03:31:41 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x <= -2)
03:31:41 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x >= -3)
03:31:41 26/03/2025 Addind predicate x >= -3 to verify set
03:31:41 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['x >= -3']
03:31:41 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (>= x (- 3))
03:31:41 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((x >= -3))
03:31:41 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x >= -3))
03:31:41 26/03/2025 # Result
03:31:41 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x >= -3))
