03:56:19 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(octant == 3)

03:56:19 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(x < octant)
03:56:19 26/03/2025 Addind predicate x < octant to verify set
03:56:19 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['x > 0', 'x < octant']
03:56:19 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (> x 0) (< x octant))
03:56:19 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((x > 0) && (x < octant))
03:56:19 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((x > 0) && (x < octant))
03:56:19 26/03/2025 # Result
03:56:19 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((x > 0) && (x < octant))
03:56:19 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
03:56:19 26/03/2025 The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
03:56:19 26/03/2025 The total runtime was 10.212436199188232 seconds
