05:01:02 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
05:01:02 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i == l)
05:01:02 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(l > 0)
05:01:02 26/03/2025 Addind predicate l > 0 to verify set
05:01:02 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['l > 0']
05:01:02 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (> l 0)
05:01:02 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((l > 0))
05:01:02 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((l > 0))
05:01:02 26/03/2025 # Result
05:01:02 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((l > 0))
05:01:02 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
05:01:02 26/03/2025 The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
