03:32:21 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
03:32:21 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(s == 0)
03:32:21 26/03/2025 Addind predicate s == 0 to verify set
03:32:21 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['s == 0']
03:32:21 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (= s 0)
03:32:21 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((s == 0))
03:32:21 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((s == 0))
03:32:21 26/03/2025 # Result
03:32:21 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((s == 0))
03:32:21 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
03:32:21 26/03/2025 The model runtime was 0.0 seconds
03:32:21 26/03/2025 The total runtime was 0.3767557144165039 seconds
