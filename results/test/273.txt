05:20:53 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
05:20:53 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i >= 0)
05:20:53 26/03/2025 Addind predicate i >= 0 to verify set
05:20:53 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(i <= 200)
05:20:53 26/03/2025 Addind predicate i <= 200 to verify set
05:20:53 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['i >= 0', 'i <= 200']
05:20:53 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (>= i 0) (<= i 200))
05:20:53 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((i >= 0) && (i <= 200))
05:20:53 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((i >= 0) && (i <= 200))
05:20:53 26/03/2025 # Result
05:20:53 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((i >= 0) && (i <= 200))
05:20:53 26/03/2025 0 counter examples were generated for the model proposals, with 0 repeated fails
