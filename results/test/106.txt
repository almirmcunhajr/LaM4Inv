02:02:29 26/03/2025 Executing predicate filtering for preconditions
02:02:29 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(k == 0)
02:02:29 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(a <= m)
02:02:29 26/03/2025 Addind predicate a <= m to verify set
02:02:29 26/03/2025 Filtering predicates for candidate assert(j < 1)
02:02:29 26/03/2025 Addind predicate j < 1 to verify set
02:02:29 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering verify set: ['a <= m', 'j < 1']
02:02:29 26/03/2025 Verifying formula: (and (<= a m) (< j 1))
02:02:29 26/03/2025 For candidate: assert((a <= m) && (j < 1))
02:02:29 26/03/2025 Predicate filtering found solution: assert((a <= m) && (j < 1))
02:02:29 26/03/2025 # Result
02:02:29 26/03/2025 Solution found by the predicate filtering mechanism using the None model: assert((a <= m) && (j < 1))
